# Optimal (beta)
A python metaheuristic optimization library. Built for easy extension and usage.

Warning: Optimal is in beta. API may change. I will do my best to note any breaking changes in this readme, but no guarantee is given.

Supported metaheuristics:

* Genetic algorithms (GA)
* Gravitational search algorithm (GSA)
* Cross entropy (CE)

# Installation
    pip install optimal

# Usage
	import math

	from optimal import GenAlg
	from optimal import Problem
	from optimal import helpers

	# The genetic algorithm uses binary solutions.
	# A decode function is useful for converting the binary solution to real numbers
	def decode_ackley(binary):
		# Helpful functions from helpers are used to convert binary to float
		# x1 and x2 range from -5.0 to 5.0
		x1 = helpers.binary_to_float(binary[0:16], -5.0, 5.0)
		x2 = helpers.binary_to_float(binary[16:32], -5.0, 5.0)
		return x1, x2

	# ackley is our fitness function
	# This is how a user defines the goal of their problem
	def ackley_fitness(solution):
		x1, x2 = solution

		# Ackley's function
		# A common mathematical optimization problem
		output = -20 * math.exp(-0.2 * math.sqrt(0.5 * (x1**2 + x2**2))) - math.exp(
			0.5 * (math.cos(2 * math.pi * x1) + math.cos(2 * math.pi * x2))) + 20 + math.e

		# You can prematurely stop the metaheuristic by returning True
		# as the second return value
		# Here, we consider the problem solved if the output is <= 0.01
		finished = output <= 0.01

		# Because this function is trying to minimize the output,
		# a smaller output has a greater fitness
		fitness = 1 / output

		# First return argument must be a real number
		# The higher the number, the better the solution
		# Second return argument is a boolean, and optional
		return fitness, finished

	# Define a problem instance to optimize
	# We can optionally include a decode function
	# The optimizer will pass the decoded solution into your fitness function
	# Additional fitness function and decode function parameters can also be added
	ackley = Problem(ackley_fitness, decode_function=decode_ackley)

	# Create a genetic algorithm with a chromosome size of 32,
	# and use it to solve our problem
	my_genalg = GenAlg(32)
	best_solution = my_genalg.optimize(ackley)

	print best_solution

Important notes:

* Fitness function must take solution as its first argument
* Fitness function must return a real number as its first return value

# Major Changes
## 08/27/2017
Moved a number of options from Optimizer to Optimizer.optimize

## 07/26/2017
Renamed common.random\_solution\_binary to common.random\_binary\_solution,
and common.random\_solution\_real to common.random\_real\_solution

## 11/10/2016
problem now an argument of Optimizer.optimize, instead of Optimizer.\_\_init\_\_.

## 11/10/2016
max\_iterations now an argument of Optimizer.optimize, instead of Optimizer.\_\_init\_\_.

## 11/8/2016
Optimizer now takes a problem instance, instead of a fitness function and kwargs.

## 11/5/2016
Library reorganized with greater reliance on \_\_init\_\_.py.

Optimizers can now be imported with:

    from optimal import GenAlg, GSA, CrossEntropy

Etc.
